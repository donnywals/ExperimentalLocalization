# Experimental Localization system with SwiftUI, callAsFunction and Combine

The code in this repository is likely incomplete and not fit for production purposes. It was used to demonstrate several new concepts like reactive programming, SwiftUI and Swift 5.2's callAsFunction. I recommend that you take the code in this repository with a grain of salt, and use it to get going with some basic SwiftUI and Combine principles that you might be able to build a full-blown system from.
